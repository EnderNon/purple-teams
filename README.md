# purple-teams
my funny css file for teams that adds a dark purple theme. it's not meant to look pretty.
I made this for the sole reason to try and learn css injection. My electron css injector is not public, sorry.
The theme is dark purple. I've also included some comments explaining where I got my colours from and what some of the colour settings are used for.
